    Unlocking the Potentials of Dropshipping business
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Dropshipping is one of the trending online business models which has
    attracted a lot of entrepreneurs. If you have an interest in e-commerce
    then chances are you have already heard the term dropshipping. Not only
    heard but also entrepreneurs who are engaged in dropshipping know that it’s
    one of the most profitable businesses yet not everyone holds the key to
    unlock its potential .

</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Dropshipping is a business model where a seller can sell products without
    owning any inventory and have the products delivered to the customers via
    the supplier who holds the inventory of the product. The merchants sell the
    products without even seeing or handling the products directly. Then, the
    third-party supplier ships the products to the customer when they receive
    the order from a merchant.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    There were 1.32 billion online shoppers in 2014 which rapidly rose to 1.8
    billion in 2018 and 2.05 billion online buyers in 2020.

    Is Dropshipping profitable?
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Dropshipping attracts entrepreneurs and businesses while its profitability
    depends on how well they utilize the platform. Once we have the basic
    knowledge about it and tools to analyze our performance, dropshipping can
    be profitable in a sustainable way. Research by
    <a href="https://torchbankz.com/dropshipping-statistics/">
        https://torchbankz.com/dropshipping-statistics/
    </a>
    shows “Dropshippers Can Earn More Than 50% Profit Than Those Who Keep Their
    Own Stock Inventory”

    />
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Some of the reasons dropshipping remain profitable are :
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Low Overhead Costs :
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The costs of running the business are relatively low. Dropshipping
    companies don't have to spend on costs like office rent, salary expenses,
    repairs, etc as compared to physical offices.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Easy to scale up
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Once the business hits the ground running, we can easily scale it up to
    cater to larger audiences. The costs of scaling don’t increase in equal
    measure as the increase in customers targeted.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Low entry barriers
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Dropshipping can be pursued by users with no business experience and as
    long as we learn the basics we can immediately start our business and learn
    as we progress. Most people can make an easy entry to this business and
    compete with others.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Is Dropshipping Legal?
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Dropshipping is a perfectly legal business model of order fulfillment.
    There are no laws or policies that prohibit the use of dropshipping
    services. Also, we must acquire appropriate licenses to sell all the
    products. Likewise, we should ensure the quality of the products is as
    promised.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <img

        width="462"
        height="327"
    />
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    However, we must be well informed about the following mistakes :
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Prohibited Products
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Although we can sell the products without handling them ourselves, we must
    be aware of the marketplaces’ policy and knowledge on products that can be
    sold in our country. Furthermore, Prohibited and restricted products may
    include products like Medications, Pornography, Weapons, Alcohol, etc.

<p dir="ltr">
    Counterfeit and knock off
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Counterfeit products look like original products and infringe trademark and
    copyright. Suppliers may produce counterfeit goods and low-quality products
    but the seller will be liable if the seller sells those products. To avoid
    scams, know

    Sales channels are the platforms where dropshipping services can be carried
    out. Customers choose their products and place an order from the sales
    channel in the beginning. Nonetheless, the suitability of the sales
    channels may vary depending on the products. One specific channel may not
    fulfill the needs of all types of products. Some of the sales channels are

Social media platforms like<a href="http://face"> Facebook</a>,    <a href="https://pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>, etc help sellers to find

    a shop button to our Facebook page and directly sell products from there.

    Analysis and Planning
